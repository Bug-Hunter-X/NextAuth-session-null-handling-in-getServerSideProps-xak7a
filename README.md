# NextAuth Session Null Handling in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a bug related to handling null sessions within `getServerSideProps` when using NextAuth.js in Next.js 15.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when attempting to access `session.user.email` inside `getServerSideProps` when the `session` object is null.  While the console correctly logs `null`, the application still tries to access the property, causing an error. This is inconsistent behavior and presents a potential challenge in managing user authentication flows.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.  Notice the error if not logged in.
5. Log in via the NextAuth setup (if configured).

## Solution

The solution involves adding a proper null check before accessing `session.user.email` to handle cases where the user isn't authenticated.  See `aboutSolution.js` for the corrected code.

## Additional Notes

This bug highlights the importance of thorough null checks, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and potentially null values from external libraries like NextAuth.js.
